## Technology

As you might have seen I use NodeJS for the server side programming.
ExpressJS is my weapon of choice to conquer the fight of writing a webserver.
What might be against your expectations is the fact that I do not use any
well known database software. My approach is a simple NoSQL solution with a self written
database driver.
Why did I do that? Well I am not sure my self. Probably because it is more lightweight
and reduced to the needs of this software.
